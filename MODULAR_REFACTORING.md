# Summary of Modular Refactoring

## Overview

We've refactored the original `generator.py` into a proper Python package structure while ensuring backward compatibility. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to use as a library.

## Key Aspects of the Modular Design

1. **Preserved Original Script**: The original `generator.py` script still works exactly as before.

2. **Same Templates Directory**: The refactored code uses the exact same `/templates` directory, with no changes needed.

3. **Backward Compatible**: Users can continue using the script as they always have.

4. **Package Structure**: Added proper Python package structure for better maintainability.

5. **Docker Support**: All Docker-related functionality is preserved without changes.

## File Structure and Relations

```
generator.py              # Original entry point (unchanged functionality)
mcp_generator.py          # Alternative entry point using modular code
openapi_mcp_generator/    # Package containing modular components
    __init__.py           # Package initialization 
    cli.py                # Command-line interface
    generator.py          # Main generator module
    generators.py         # Code generators
    http.py               # HTTP client utilities
    parser.py             # OpenAPI parser
    project.py            # Project builder (uses templates/)
templates/                # Original templates directory (unchanged)
    ...
```

## How the Modular Code Uses the Original Templates

The `ProjectBuilder` class in `project.py` initializes with the path to the templates directory:

```python
# In generator.py in the modular package
TEMPLATE_DIR = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))), "templates")
```

This ensures that the modular code uses the exact same templates as the original script.

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Better Organization**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Functions can be imported and used programmatically
4. **Packageability**: Can be installed as a proper Python package

## Using the Modular Code

You can use the refactored code in multiple ways:

1. Continue using `generator.py` exactly as before
2. Install as a package and use the `mcp-generator` command
3. Import functions for use in your own Python code
